# 🛡️ ASDM: Adaptive Security & Defense Mechanism Framework

## 📌 Overview
ASDM is a modular framework for detecting and mitigating cyber-attacks in **Software Defined Networking (SDN) + IoT** environments.  
It combines **detection, mitigation, collaboration, and trust adaptation** into one orchestrated pipeline.  

This repository contains a **fully functional prototype** that simulates real-world attacks (DDoS, HTTP floods, mixed floods, ARP spoofing) inside a **Mininet testbed**, while applying defense logic automatically.
