## üìò Solution Manual

ASDM can be deployed in **two modes**:  
1. üñ•Ô∏è **Emulation Environment** (for research and testing)  
2. üåê **Real-World Deployment** (for production SD-IoT networks)  

---

### üñ•Ô∏è 1. Emulation Environment (Mininet + P4 + Simulator)

This mode is ideal for experiments, reproducibility, and validation.

#### Step 1: Environment Setup
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
sudo apt-get install mininet
```
#### Step 2: Prepare Models
```bash
python3 src/sad/generate_model.py
python3 src/sad/generate_scaler.py
```
This builds and saves the hybrid LSTM‚ÄìGRU model and the feature scaler used for SAD (Sequential Attack Detection).

#### Step 3: Start Controller
```bash
python3 -m controller.controller_manager
```
This orchestrates ACD, SAD, TSTA, and DAM modules.

#### Step 4: Launch Network Topology
```bash
sudo python3 topology/asdm_topo.py
```
This deploys a Mininet network with SDN switches and IoT devices.

#### Step 5: Simulate Attacks
```bash
python3 attack_simulator/attack_launcher.py --attack udp
python3 attack_simulator/attack_launcher.py --attack tcp
python3 attack_simulator/attack_launcher.py --attack http
python3 attack_simulator/attack_launcher.py --attack mix
Supported attack types: UDP Flood, TCP SYN Flood, HTTP Flood, Mixed Flood.
```

#### Step 6: Monitor Results
Logs saved in:
```bash
Copy code
experiments/results_logs/
```
Example files: acd_C1.log, sad_C1.log
Metrics reported: detection time, mitigation latency, CPU usage, recovery %

### üåê 2. Real-World Deployment (SD-IoT Network)
This mode integrates ASDM with real SDN controllers, IoT/edge devices, and P4-enabled switches.

#### Step 1: Deploy Controller
Install ASDM on your controller host and run:

```bash
python3 -m controller.controller_manager
```

#### Step 2: Connect IoT/Edge Device

Configure IoT devices to forward traffic via the SDN switch.
Ensure OpenFlow or P4Runtime communication with the controller.

#### Step 3: Enable SAD + TSTA

SAD (Sequential Attack Detection): Detects anomalies over time.
TSTA (Temporal-Spatial Threat Analysis): Assesses device trustworthiness.

#### Step 4: Real Traffic & Attack Injection

Deploy normal IoT workloads (e.g., MQTT, CoAP, HTTP).
Launch controlled attacks (e.g., UDP/TCP floods) from test nodes.

#### Step 5: Adaptive Mitigation (DAM)

Suspicious flows are rate-limited, rerouted, or blacklisted.
Normal traffic remains unaffected to ensure service continuity.

#### Step 6: Validate Performance

Monitor CPU and bandwidth overhead of the controller.
Check recovery >98% and latency <12 ms (detection).
Logs and analysis exported to experiments/results_logs/.
